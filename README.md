# chexpert_labeler_operations
All the operations we performed using labels annotated using chexpert labels.

Here you have to use 'Baseline3_extraction_SAT.ipynb' to extract a baseline 3 report. You have to place a source file (which is chexpert based labels, computed using chexpert labels, against a training data)

'chexpert_labeler_baseline' can be used to compute all the clinical validation measures between candidate reports and reference reports with respect to chexpert based labels.
