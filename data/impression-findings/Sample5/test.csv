I do not see evidence for fracture or destructive process. AP view of the femur shows no femoral XXXX destructive process or other significant abnormality. For of the Left hip shows nearcomplete obliteration of the joint space with severe subchondral sclerosis and cystic formation in both the superior acetabulum and superior aspect of the femoral head. No fracture or destructive process is identified. Surgical markers were XXXX in the images and left hip for the purpose of surgical planning. PA and lateral chest show the lungs to be clear. There may be some hyperinflation. No pleural effusion is identified. The heart is normal in size. There are calcified mediastinal lymph XXXX. The skeletal structures appear normal. .Severe arthritic changes in both hips left worse than right. Possible COPD but no acute pulmonary disease.

Pulmonary vasculature is normal in caliber. There is minimal XXXX atelectasis or scar in the left lung base. The lungs are otherwise grossly clear. There is a small calcified granuloma in the left upper lobe. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. No acute displaced rib fractures are demonstrated. Minimal left basilar atelectasis or scar. No acute displaced rib fractures demonstrated.

No alveolar consolidation no findings of pleural effusion or pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Sshaped spine curvature noted. Cardiomegaly no acute pulmonary findings
